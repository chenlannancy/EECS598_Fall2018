"Search" covers Lecture 2-4 (Chapter 3-4).
- Python code search.py and IPython Notebook search.pynb are included.

(1) search.py
    a. Uninformed Search algorithms
     - Breadth-first Search
     - Depth-first Search
     - Uniform-cost Search
     - Depth-limited Search
     - Iterative deepening deep-first Search
     - Bidirection Search
    b. Informed (Heuristic) Search
     - Greedy best-first Search 
     - A* Search
    c. Local Search
     - Hill-climbing search
     - Simulated annealing
     - Local beam search
     - Genetic search

(2) search.pynb
    The notebook is about learning about a specific kind of problem solving - building goal-based agents that can plan ahead to solve problems. In particular, navigation problem/route finding problem is exmained. Precisely defining problems and their solutions is the first step. Several general-purpose search algorithms are included.
